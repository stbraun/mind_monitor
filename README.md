This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get this application up and running. Unfortunately the application doesn't exist yet ;-)

### What is this repository for? ###

### Quick summary

Module to access NeuroSKY Mindwave devices from Python code.

MindWave is a device allowing to capture raw and also pre-processed EEG data. It is quite limited because there is only one sensor, but it's fine for some experiments.

The device connects via Bluetooth to the computer. There is a low-level COM and a nice socket based protocol.
Data can be read as Json string and therefore easily processed using Python.

Currently MongoDB is used for persisitence. A simple graph of the captured data based on matplotlib is provided.
