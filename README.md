* Version: 0.0.1dev

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get this application up and running. Currently the app is under development.

### Quick summary

Module to access NeuroSKY Mindwave devices from Python code.

MindWave is a device allowing to capture raw and also pre-processed EEG data. It is quite limited because there is only one sensor, but it's fine for some experiments.

The device connects via Bluetooth to the computer. There is a low-level COM and a nice socket based protocol.
Data can be read as Json string and therefore easily processed using Python.

Currently *MongoDB* is used for persistence. A simple graph of the captured data based on *matplotlib* is provided.
